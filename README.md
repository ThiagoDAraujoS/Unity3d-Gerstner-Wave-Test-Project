# Gerstner Wave Test Field
### About
This is a unity project dedicated to the ongoing study of Gerstner's wave algorithm, it contains many attempts to manipulate the algorithm in different ways to achieve a stylized set of waves

Check out this [wave example video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP40sirM9u0) for some context on what's going on in this project.
